Version Control for jQuery is one of the easiest ways to control the version of jQuery used on your website.

== Description ==
Version Control for jQuery is one of the easiest ways to control the version of jQuery used on your website. Whether you just want to run a stable WordPress website, or if you are a developer and want to cross check your website with the various version of jQuery, the plugin will always have the latest minified version of jQuery ready for you, loaded from the fast jQuery CDN. The plugin will default to the latest pre-release of both jQuery Core and jQuery Migrate, but this can easily be changed from the settings page, in case you prefer to use the latest official release.

Please notice that no files are replaced, therefore deactivation of this plugin returns your site to its original state.
